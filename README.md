# Cirq---QKD-BB84
Demonstration of a Quantum Key Distribution Protocol - BB84. 
In this, there will be 4 different demonstrations expressing the roles of Alice, Bob, and our "hacker," Eve.
1. The use and purpose of the protocol without Eve.
2. Eve's Measurement Attack.
3. Eve's Intercept and Resend Attack
4. Eve's Entanglement Attack

You will see that no matter what Eve tries to do, Alice and Bob will always be able to tell when she is Eavesdropping and intercepting these messages.
